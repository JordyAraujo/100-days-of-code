# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 26, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've been Trying to format the CSV output from the [Freematics Telelogger (firmware_v5)](https://github.com/stanleyhuangyc/Freematics/tree/master/firmware_v5/telelogger).

**Thoughts** I've found a way to log data without the buffer, which would work without internet connection. Formatting is not complete and I'm having some WiFi connection problems.

**Link(s) to work**
